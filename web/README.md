# Web Exploitation

This directory serves as a vault for different types of web-based CTF challenges.
Each subfolder contains the exact methods, approaches, and scripts used to solve
specific vulnerabilities encountered during competitions or practice.

The goal is to keep all web exploitation techniques organized, repeatable, and
easy to reference whenever needed.
