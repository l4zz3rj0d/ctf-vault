# 🛰️ OSINT Challenge – Identifying Horizon Hall (GMU)
# #️⃣ 1. Initial Visual Analysis

The provided photo showed several key features:

Distinctive brown brick academic building across a courtyard

A large radio/telecom tower rising directly behind it

A curving stone retaining wall in the bottom-right

Gray interlocking paver walkway

E-scooters near lamp posts

Dense Autumn trees blocking part of the view

Clear reflections — indicating the photo was taken from inside a building

These details pointed toward a modern U.S. university campus.

# #️⃣ 2. Yandex Reverse Image Search

We used Yandex to reverse-search tree patterns, brickwork, and walkway curves from the image.

Yandex returned high-confidence matches for:

George Mason University (GMU), Fairfax Campus

The returning matches included the same:

lamp post design

paver pattern

telecom tower

brick architecture

So the university was confirmed.

# #️⃣ 3. Mapping the GMU Location

Now the task was to discover exactly which building the photo was taken from.

✔ Telecom Tower as the anchor

The tall tower behind the building is the well-known:

Johnson Center Radio Tower

This immediately locks the direction.

✔ Matching the brown building

The long rectangular brown building with narrow black windows is:

Exploratory Hall (formerly part of Robinson complex)

So the photographer must be facing toward Exploratory Hall.

✔ Walkway & Retaining Wall

The curved retaining wall + grey block pavers exactly match the walkway between:

Horizon Hall

Exploratory Hall

The wall on the right is a distinctive structure attached to Horizon Hall’s plaza level.

# #️⃣ 4. Triangulating the Photographer’s Position

By comparing:

elevation

window reflections

angle to radio tower

alignment with trees & walkway

relative offset from Exploratory Hall

…it became clear that the image could only be taken from:

# 🎯 Horizon Hall (GMU)

2nd or 3rd floor, facing Northwest.

This is the only building that gives:

the correct height

this exact curve of the walkway

this line-of-sight to Exploratory Hall + tower

identical landscaping

Perfect match.
